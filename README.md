Multimodal Information Retrieval

In this project, we designed a few fusion approaches to combine image retrieval and text retrieval to improve the retrieval qualtiy.

Two datasets were prepared in the data/base/ folder, including a multimodal dataset downloaded from Google and another one downloaded from Twiiter.
